Too Short, love the way you make that hit
Here's to you, keep rhymin' and boy don't quit
I carry big fat wads, I treat my girls like god
Ask 'em "who do they love?" and they all say Tod ...

Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing
The samples that they using, can't get through the clearing
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it ...

Most times when I rhyme wouldn't be like that
Cause the way I write rhymes you will comprehend
And if you call me fake I'll say so what
I keep rappin' to the very end ...

It's just one hard rapper spittin' a rap
Not 3 or 4 sucka's or a couple of saps
Like born to Mack I'll cash a check
Walkin' 'round like a fool livin' up to his rep ...

I'm out my ramen noodle
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
We have nothing in common, poodle
Appeal with the skin color of mine

Sons, daughters, paper reporters
Receive my command and follow our orders
Deserves no need to explain
Plain simple, created by the temple, the brain

The spin extends another plate blends and
It corresponds to the message I've sent
Even destroy boys with a safety pen
Men who try to dis I discipline
Then I'll diminish, cities I conquer
If I'm a toy boy, I'm tough as Tonka
Visualize me on your MTV
These rhymes I design is called poetry ...
